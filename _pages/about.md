My name is (Alexander) Niema Moshiri, and I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Computer Science & Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/). I work on computational biology, with a research focus on viral phylogenetics and epidemiology. I also place a heavy emphasis on teaching, namely on the development of online educational content, primarily Massive Adaptive Interactive Texts (MAITs), and I recently gave a TEDx talk on the subject, which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/5JKgUoY9pTg). You can watch my Ph.D. defense [here](http://bit.ly/niema-phd-defense), and you can read my Ph.D. dissertation [here](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/62s7q92d).

In addition to my appointment in the Computer Science & Engineering Department at UCSD, I have the following affiliations:
* [Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program](https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/)
* [Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://dbmi.ucsd.edu/) ([UCSD School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/))
* [Pandemic Response to Emerging Pathogens, Antimicrobial Resistance and Equity (PREPARE) Institute](https://prepare.ucsd.edu/)
