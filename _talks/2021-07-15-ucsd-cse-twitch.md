The <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science & Engineering Department</a> at UC San Diego holds a series of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ucsd_cse" target="_blank">Twitch Live Streams</a> between the Department Chair and various guests to discuss various topics of interest to students and to the general public. I was the co-host of the inaugural Live Stream of this series, during which I discussed my research, reflected on my path to academia, and gave advice for professional development for students.
