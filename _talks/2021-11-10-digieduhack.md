The <a href="https://ircai.org/" target="_blank">International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI)</a>, under the auspices of the <a href="https://unesco.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)</a>, has been asked through the Government of Slovenia by Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC) to host, during the Slovenian presidency to the European Council (Jul-Dec 2021), the main stage of the <a href="https://digieduhack.com/" target="_blank">Digital Education Hackathon (DigiEduHack)</a>, a flagship initiative of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en" target="_blank">Digital Education Action Plan</a>. DigiEduHack is an EIT initiative under the European Commissionâ€™s Digital Education Action Plan, led by EIT Climate-KIC and coordinated by Aalto University. This year the main stage event is hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in cooperation with the International Research Center on Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI) under the auspices of UNESCO. DigiEduHack is a series of online and in-person hackathons taking place all around the world on 9-10 November 2021, focusing on co-creating digital education solutions for a more sustainable world. DigiEduHack is free, inclusive, sustainable, open to anyone worldwide. DigiEduHack aims at fostering user-driven, co-created solutions, ranging from concepts or ideas to fully implementable apps. Stakeholders from the whole educational spectrum, as well as NGOs, startups, libraries, research labs, or ministries, engage in DigiEduHack in a bid to identify and solve key challenges in digital education.
