The <a href="https://ubicucsd.wixsite.com/ubic" target="_blank">Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC)</a> represents UCSD's undergraduates who are studying in or interested in the diverse field of bioinformatics. Through a combination of events, programs, and projects, their mission is to educate and contribute to the education and aspirations of every bioinformatics student at UCSD. Throughout the 2020-2021 academic year, UBIC hosted a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/IAmA" target="_blank">Reddit AMAs (Ask Me Anything)</a>, during which students could post questions on Reddit to be answered by a predetermined guest speaker. I was the first guest of the AMA series (see the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/hzjl8d/i_am_niema_moshiri_a_bioinformatician_and/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CgXMYFBojQ" target="_blank">recording of the AMA</a>).
