<a href="https://www.facebook.com/envisionariesUCSD/" target="_blank">EnVisionaries at UC San Diego</a> is a student organization that aims to (1) educate students in Engineering, Visual Arts, design, and manufacturing processes,  (2) support the Envision Maker Studio and other UCSD maker studios working directly with Envision Maker Studio in their goals to provide students with an environment to connect theory with practice, (3) provide a forum for the discussion and exchange of ideas related to Engineering, Visual Arts, and the development of the maker studios, and (4) provide a platform of integration for non-arts or engineering students to learn and work within maker spaces. They held a series of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/610194613335437" target="_blank">"Meet the Profs" Q&A sessions</a>, and I was invited to speak at one.
