I was invited to speak at <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/22004" target="_blank">TEDxUCSD 2017</a>, and my talk was titled <i>The Era of Online Learning</i>. The recording can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/5JKgUoY9pTg" target="_blank">here</a>.

The TEDx Program is designed to help communities, organizations and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences. At TEDx events, a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters and TED Talks videos — sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, under a free license granted by TED.
