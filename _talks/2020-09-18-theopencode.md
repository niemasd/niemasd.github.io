<a href="https://www.theopencode.org/" target="_blank">TheOpenCode</a> is a not-for-profit organization that aims to provide students from low-income families the education and resources required to pursue a career in computer science. Through their bootcamps, accelerators, and other programs, they reach people from around the world. As a guest speaker, I ran a workshop titled <a href="https://www.theopencode.org/a-viral-analysis-workflow/" target="_blank"><i>A Viral Analysis Workflow</i></a>, in which I demonstrated how to run a standard phylogenetic inference workflow using an example dataset of full SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies.
