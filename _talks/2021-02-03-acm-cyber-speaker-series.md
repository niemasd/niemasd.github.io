<a href="https://www.facebook.com/cyberucsd" target="_blank">ACM Cyber</a> is a UCSD student organization designed to expand the knowledge of cybersecurity for all students. As part of their mission, they host various workshops, panel discussions, capture the flag events, and other programs covering the latest in cybersecurity. In February 2021, ACM Cyber invited me to give a talk about the history of video game console hacking and security, titled <a href="https://youtu.be/MIgXVk4SLCQ" target="_blank"><i>Video Game Console Hacking, a History</i></a>. I reached out to the popular video game console security YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ModernVintageGamer" target="_blank">ModernVintageGamer</a>, who delivered the talk with me as a co-speaker.
