The <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Jacobs School of Engineering (JSOE)</a> at UC San Diego hosts an annual <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/programs/transfer-summer-prep" target="_blank">Transfer Prep program</a>, which is a virtual 5-day program held over the summer for incoming transfer engineering students. This free program provides incoming students with the opportunity to acclimate to campus life, build skills and habits necessary for success in engineering, and develop community amongst their peers before beginning their courses in the fall. In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Transfer Prep was offered as a virtual program, and I participated in the "Virtual Coffee Chats" portion of the program, which was a networking event for incoming transfer students to have their first interactions with faculty and gain a better understanding of the diversity in research within the engineering departments.
