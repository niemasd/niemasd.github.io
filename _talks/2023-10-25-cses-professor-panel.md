The <a href="https://csesucsd.com/" target="_blank">Computer Science & Engineering Society (CSES)</a> at UC San Diego student organization hosted a "Professor Panel," during which undergraduate students in the audience asked questions about various topics, ranging from pursuing research, success in courses, graduate school, etc. I was invited to speak as a panelist.
