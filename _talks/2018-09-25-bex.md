The <a href="https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/138" target="_blank">Bioinformatics Exchange (BEx)</a> brings together leading faculty and Bioinformatics graduate students at the University of California, San Diego to discuss and present their work in this exciting area of research. This annual one day symposium offers a unique opportunity for students in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program, as well as students interested in Bioinformatics, to get acquainted with the wide spectrum of research topics in the field. I gave a talk that focused on statistical modeling of viral epidemics, namely the <a href="https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES" target="_blank">FAVITES simulation framework</a> that I developed.
