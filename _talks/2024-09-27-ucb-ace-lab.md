The UC Berkeley <a href="https://acelab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Algorithms for Computing and Education (ACE) Lab</a> brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from Computer Science, the iSchool, and the Graduate School of Education, working at the intersection of education and computing. Our projects involve novel educational software that helps educators educate better and students learn better, spanning traditional, online, and hybrid learning. I was invited to give a talk in the ACE Lab Talk Series titled <i>A scalable approach for detecting exam similarity in CS courses</i>.
