The <a href="https://eceusc.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering Undergraduate Student Council (ECE USC)</a> is the voice of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) students at UC San Diego. Through community building, networking, and leadership, the council strives to effect change within the department and campus at large though various events and programs. In February 2021, ECE USC hosted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/IAmA" target="_blank">AMA (Ask Me Anything)</a> panel consisting of professors in various departments within the <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Jacobs School of Engineering (JSOE)</a>, during which students could ask seek advice from their professors. ECE USC invited me to represent the <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) Department</a>.
