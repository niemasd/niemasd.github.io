The <a href="https://www.saseconnect.org/" target="_blank">Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE)</a> hosts annual <a href="https://www.saseconnect.org/regional-conferences" target="_blank">regional conferences</a> that aim for students from chapters in the West Region to come together for a day of networking, professional and personal development, discovering programs from other chapters, and more. I was invited as a UC San Diego Computer Science & Engineering professor to speak on a panel about academic vs. industry career paths.
