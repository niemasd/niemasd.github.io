The <a href="https://datascience.sdsc.edu/" target="_blank">Data Science Hub</a> at the <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/" target="_blank">San Diego Supercomputer Center</a> is a community hub where experts from SDSC and other units of the university can apply their experience in building and participating in collaborative, multi-disciplinary data science teams to help provide solutions to regional, national, and global challenges, including smart cities, precision medicine, advanced manufacturing, and data center automation. My talk was titled <i>Standardized Environments using JupyterHub</i>.
