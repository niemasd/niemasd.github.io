The UC San Diego chapter of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shpeucsd" target="_blank">Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)</a> organized a high school outreach event named "ENVISION," during which high school children and their parents / family members learned about engineering education at UC San Diego. I was invited to give the opening talk of the event.
