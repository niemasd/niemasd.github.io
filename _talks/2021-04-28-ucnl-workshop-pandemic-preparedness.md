The <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/research-initiatives/programs/lab-fees/index.html" target="_blank">UC National Laboratory Fees Research Program</a> enhances partnerships between UC researchers and laboratory scientists at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)</a> and <a href="https://lanl.gov/" target="_blank">Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)</a>. In April 2021, they held a Workshop on Pandemic Preparedness, and I was an invited speaker.
