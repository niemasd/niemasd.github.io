I was invited to give a talk at the seminar series hosted by the <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute</a>. In my talk, titled <i>Mathematical Modeling of Viral Evolution and Epidemiology</i>, I discussed my research efforts in the field of computational molecular viral epidemiology, namely with respect to HIV.
