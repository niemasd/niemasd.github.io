The <a href="http://www.sweetwaterschools.org/" target="_blank">Sweetwater Union High School District (SUHSD)</a> is a school district headquartered in Chula Vista, California. SUHSD is one of the most ethnically and economically diverse districts in California: approximately 87% of students belong to an ethnic minority group and over 40% of students qualify for the free or reduced lunch program. I am an alumnus of SUHSD (Bonita Vista High School class of 2011). The College and Career Readiness/CTE department of SUHSD coordinated a virtual districtwide Career Night Series, which was intended for 7th-12th grade students and their parents. On March 2, 2022, the Career Night Series held a panel to discuss career paths in Computer Science, and I was an invited panelist.
