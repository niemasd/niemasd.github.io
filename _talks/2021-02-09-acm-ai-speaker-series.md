<a href="https://ai.acmucsd.com/" target="_blank">ACM AI</a> is a UCSD student organization aiming to build a community of AI enthusiasts at UCSD and connect that community to the broader AI network. They also strive to keep AI fun and accessible to all. To achieve this goal, ACM AI hosts many workshops, competitions, networking events, research talks, and reading groups. In February 2021, ACM AI invited me to give a lecture on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model" target="_blank">Hidden Markov Models</a>.
