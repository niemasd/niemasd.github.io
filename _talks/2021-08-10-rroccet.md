<a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/website/23042/" target="_blank">RRoCCET</a> is a hub for researchers seeking to overcome the increasing inadequacy of traditional research computing infrastructure by means of migration to the public cloud. This conference is a success-driven, methods-focused event hosted and attended by researchers looking for solution paths: feasible, tractable implementation plans informed by existing case studies. I was invited to give a talk at the RRoCCET 2021 conference. My talk was titled <i>COVID-19 Genomic Analysis</i>.
