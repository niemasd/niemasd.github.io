The week-long boot camp for incoming first year students of the <a href="https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program</a> aims to 1) introduce new students to the Program, its faculty and students, the courses, and research opportunities, (2) foster student community and collaboration among students of the first year class, and to students in upper classes, (3) convey the bar for the core curriculum and key classes, as well as the research excitement and work ethic characteristic of the program's best students, and (4) provide incoming students with an opportunity to remedy deficiencies prior to taking the core classes. I gave a talk that focused on algorithms in phylogenetics as well as methods in teaching.
