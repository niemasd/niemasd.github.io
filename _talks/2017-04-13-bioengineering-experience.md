The <a href="http://bmes.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)</a> at UC San Diego hosts an annual event called "The Bioengineering Experience" that is meant to highlight the different career paths, connections, and opportunities one can develop and utilize during their time here. Our event will include presentations from current professors, past alumni, and bioengineering organizations. I was invited as a past alumnus to provide advice to undergraduates interested in Bioinformatics.
