The UCSD Chapter of <a href="https://tbp.ucsd.edu/home" target="_blank">Tau Beta Pi (TBP)</a> is a prominent engineering honors society that focuses on serving their members and the public to promote integrity and excellence in engineering. The <a href="https://saseatucsd.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Society of Asian Scientists & Engineers (SASE)</a> at UCSD is a pre-professional organization dedicated to promoting professional development and preparing undergraduates for their futures, whether it be graduate school, research in a lab, an engineer, or anything in-between. SASE helps students by organizing professional events and workshops, such as their annual networking event <i>Dining with Professionals</i>, resume workshops, and more. In May 2021, in honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, TBP and SASE held a collaborative event focused on AAPI representation in academia and research. One part of this event consisted of a Q&A Panel for students to ask STEM faculty members from AAPI backgrounds about their experiences in academia and research.
