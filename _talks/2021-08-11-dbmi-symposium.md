The UC San Diego Health <a href="https://dbmi.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI)</a> held its 11th annual <a href="https://dbmi.ucsd.edu/education/internships/index.html" target="_blank">Summer Internship (Virtual) Symposium</a> in August 2021. I gave a talk titled <i>The Academic Career Path</i>, in which I provided a general overview of the career path from undergraduate education all the way through obtaining a faculty position (e.g. Bachelor's, Ph.D., post-doc, faculty), and I provided general recommendations for opportunities to take advantage of at each stage of the path.
