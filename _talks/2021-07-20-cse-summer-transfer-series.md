The <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science & Engineering Department</a> at UC San Diego held a series of webinars for transfer students in the department: the <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/summer-transfer-series" target="_blank">CSE Summer Transfer Series</a>. I was invited to speak on a panel during one of the webinars of the series, during which the panel discussed various departmental and university-wide opportunities to engage in undergraduate research.
