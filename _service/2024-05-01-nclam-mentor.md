The <a href="https://nclam.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">National Center of Leadership in Academic Medicine (NCLAM)</a> is a Health Sciences professional development program with a mentoring component for junior faculty at UC San Diego. NCLAM helps junior faculty develop skills appropriate for their academic career, implement a personal strategic plan, and expand their network of colleagues within Health Sciences and the University. I served as a Senior Faculty Mentor to a Junior Faculty Member in this program.
