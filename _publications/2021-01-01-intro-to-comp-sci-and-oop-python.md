This interactive textbook was written with the intention of introducing beginners to the wonders of the world of Computer Science! The course assumes no prerequisite knowledge, and we hope that, by the end of the course, you will have learned how to think computationally, how to write programs in Python, and how to design classes using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

This textbook utilizes the Active Learning approach to instruction, meaning it has various activities embedded throughout to help stimulate your learning and improve your understanding of the materials we will cover. You will encounter **STOP and Think** questions that will help you reflect on the material, **Exercise Breaks** that will test your knowledge and understanding of the concepts discussed, and **Code Challenges** that will allow you to actually implement some of the concepts we will cover.
