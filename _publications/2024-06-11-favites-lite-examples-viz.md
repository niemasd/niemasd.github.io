After the rise of several different simulation tools that can simulate different aspects of an epidemic, FAVITES provides a framework to simulate an end-to-end epidemic (from contact network generation to infection transmission to viral phylogenies). To increase accessibility, FAVITES-Lite was developed with the key functionalities of FAVITES with the sacrifice of some flexibility. It remains that configuring and analyzing a complicated simulation like FAVITES or FAVITES-Lite can be extremely daunting, so we created example configuration files to help users learn the process behind parameter choice and a graph-visualization web application to help users visualize the results of their simulations.
