Resulting from multiple factors (larger enrollments, increased online course offerings, technological advances, etc.), auto-graded online assessments have become increasingly critical in supporting modern university courses. Recent advances in online assessment platforms have enabled the design and incorporation of immediate adaptive feedback that is uniquely tailored to a student's specific misconceptions. In this presentation, I will discuss how to design and develop such online assessments using the PrairieLearn platform, and I will demonstrate how I have utilized PrairieLearn to implement massively-scalable assessments in 3 vastly different courses: CSE 100 (Advanced Data Structures in C++; hybrid course), CSE 6R (Intro Python for Non-CSE Majors; online course), and CSE 185 (Advanced Bioinformatics Lab; in-person course). I will also demonstrate how, when utilized with PrairieTest via the Triton Testing Center, I have been able to reuse the assessments I developed directly within self-scheduled proctored in-person exams.
