### Objectives
This study investigates primary peer-referral engagement (PRE) strategies to assess which strategy results in engaging higher numbers of people living with HIV (PLWH) who are virally unsuppressed.

### Design
We develop a modeling study that simulates an HIV epidemic (transmission, disease progression, and viral evolution) over 6 years using an agent-based model followed by simulating PRE strategies. We investigate two PRE strategies where referrals are based on social network strategies (SNS) or sexual partner contact tracing (SPCT).

### Methods
We parameterize, calibrate, and validate our study using data from Chicago on Black sexual minority men to assess these strategies for a population with high incidence and prevalence of HIV. For each strategy we calculate the number of PLWH recruited who are undiagnosed or out- of-care and the number of direct or indirect transmissions.

### Results
SNS and SPCT identify 256.5 (95% CI: [234, 279]) and 15 (95% CI: [7, 27]) PLWH, respectively. Of these, SNS identifies approximately 159 (95% CI: [142, 177]) PLWH out-of-care and 32 (95% CI: [21, 43]]) PLWH undiagnosed compared to 9 (95% CI: [3, 18]) and 2 (95% CI: [0, 5]) for SPCT. SNS identified 15.5 (95% CI: [6, 25]) and 7.5 (95% CI: [2, 11]]) indirect and direct transmission pairs, while SPCT identified 6 (95% CI: [0, 8]) and 5 (95% CI: [0, 8]), respectively.

### Conclusion
With no testing constraints, SNS is the more effective strategy to identify undiagnosed and out- of-care PLWH. Neither strategy is successful at identifying sufficient indirect or direct transmission pairs to investigate transmission networks.
