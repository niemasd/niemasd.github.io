### Summary
Highly-used methods for identifying transmission clusters of rapidly-evolving pathogens from molecular data require a user-determined distance threshold. The choice of threshold is often motivated by epidemiological information known *a priori*, which may be unfeasible for epidemics without rich epidemiological information. TreeN93 is a fully non-parametric distance-based method for transmission cluster identification that scales polynomially.

### Availability and implementation
TreeN93 is implemented in Python 3 and is freely available at [https://github.com/niemasd/TreeN93/](https://github.com/niemasd/TreeN93/).
