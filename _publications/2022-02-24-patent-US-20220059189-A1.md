A method of searching for a query sequence of nucleotide characters within a chromosomal or genomic nucleic acid reference sequence can include receiving a query sequence representing nucleotide characters to be searched for within a reference sequence of characters represented by a reference hypervector generated by combining respective base hypervectors for each nucleotide character included in the reference sequence of characters appearing in all sub-strings of characters having a length between a specified lower length and a specified upper length within the reference sequence, combining respective near orthogonal base hypervectors for each of the nucleotide characters included in the query sequence to generate a query hypervector, and generating a dot product of the query hypervector and the reference hypervector to determine a decision score indicating a degree to which the query sequence is included in the reference sequence. Other aspects and embodiments according to the invention are also disclosed herein.
