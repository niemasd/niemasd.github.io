Students who complete the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science exam typically lack structured content post-exam. However, while students may be interested in applying their newly-gained skills to practical real-world problems, AP Computer Science teachers may not have the educational content nor the expertise to execute such supplemental lessons. In this case study, we introduce a series of short (5-day) self-paced instructional modules implemented as Massive Adaptive Interactive Texts (MAITs) on the Stepik platform. These self-paced modules can be completed primarily in the user's web browser, and they can thus be integrated into existing courses with ease. We discuss the pedagogical methods utilized in their development, and we provide an overview of the project results of the development of the first two mini-courses: "Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax" and "An Introduction to Computer Vision".
